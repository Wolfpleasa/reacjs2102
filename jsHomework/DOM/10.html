    <h3>Show More and Show Less Example</h3>

    <p>
        GeeksforGeeks was born out of necessity- a need to provide a convenient and one-stop educational portal to all the students of Computer Science.
        <span id="points">...</span>

        <span id="moreText"> This necessity was
        as personal to me as it was universal.
        This need combined with my passion for
        teaching resulted in GeeksforGeeks as
        we know today. My message to you, in
        our inaugural edition of Geeks Digest,
        would be that if you are looking for
        a problem to work on, you don’t need
        to look very far for it. All you should
        do is to look around yourself.
